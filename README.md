# powerpi
Glued together a few pieces of code to use a Raspberry Pi, Adafruit INA219, and Adafruit FONA as a power monitoring and notification system.

Disclaimer. This is rough. I never thought it would see the light of day, but maybe it will help someone with their own project. I will need to resolve all licensing requirements from copied stuff, and my own contribution hasn't been standardized.

## Required Packages
* python-smbus
* python-serial
